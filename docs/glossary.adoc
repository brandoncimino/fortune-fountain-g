Throw:: The transfer of *all physical objects* from the *hand* to the *water*
- After a *throw*, the *hand* should be _empty_.
- *Throwing* an empty *hand* will result in 1 *throw* and 0 *dunks*.
- If an item can be *thrown*, it can _also_ be *flicked*, and _vice-versa_.
- A single item cannot be both *thrown* _and_ *flicked*.
- 1 *throw* event can involve multiple items.
- A *throw* must _always_ operate on _every item in the **hand**_.

Dunk:: *Any* transfer of a *single physical object* from a person's *hand* into the *water*
- 1 *dunk* event corresponds to 1 item.
- A *dunk* should not know or care what caused it.

Flick:: The transfer of a *single physical object* from a person's *hand* into the *water*
