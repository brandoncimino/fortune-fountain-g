This is a dummy file, used so that the `Assets/Scripts/Runtime/Sketchbook` folder will properly appear in Git (because, by design, Git doesn't include empty directories).

The entire `Assets/Scripts/Runtime/Sketchbook` is included inside of the project `.gitignore`, so put anything in here that you want to experiment with but don't want to accidentally commit changes to.

Note that this shouldn't need a `.meta` file, but I left it in there rather than confuse Unity.
